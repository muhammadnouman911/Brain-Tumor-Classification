# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification

This project focuses on classifying brain MRI images into two categories using deep learning:

- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**

The model is trained using a dataset of MRI scans, and aims to assist in the early detection of brain tumors using image classification techniques.
